## [v2.2.2] – 2026-03-01
### Added
- Integrated **Low Latency Streaming** compatibility with MAF V2 Orchestrator. The UI now implements native `fetch` with `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`.
- Added reactive buffering UI logic parsing to safely extract 36-char `conversation_id` from the raw byte stream chunk.
### Fixed
- Fixed streaming network fragmentation loss when reading UTF-8 characters via `TextDecoder(stream=True)`.

## [v2.2.1] – 2026-02-04
### Fixed
- Simplified docker image
- Fixed Docker builds on ARM-based machines by explicitly setting the target platform to `linux/amd64`, preventing Azure Container Apps deployment failures.
### Changed
- Pinned the Docker base image to `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/python:3.12-bookworm` to ensure stable package verification behavior across environments.
- Bumped `aiohttp` to `3.13.3`.
- Standardized on the container best practice of using a non-privileged port (`8080`) instead of a privileged port (`80`), reducing the risk of runtime/permission friction and improving stability of long-running ingestion workloads.

## [v2.2.0] – 2026-01-15
### Added
- Added support for Microsoft Entra ID authentication in the UI and forwarding the end-user access token to the orchestrator; this token is used to validate the user and propagate retrieval authorization, enabling document-level security.

## [v2.0.2] – 2025-08-18
### Added
- Early Docker validation in the PowerShell deployment script (`deploy.ps1`), including checks for CLI presence, service status, and Docker Desktop availability, with clearer error messages and guidance.

### Fixed
- Orchestrator client (`orchestrator_client.py`) now defaults `ORCHESTRATOR_APP_APIKEY` to an empty string if not set, preventing key errors.
- Dapr API token handling improved: header included only if token is present, with missing token warnings downgraded to debug-level logs.
- Refined error messages for orchestrator invocation failures to clarify the source of errors.
- Improved debug mode toggle handling in the deployment script for clearer output.
